## Feature Area: Quality (Testing, Refactoring, and Bug Fixes)

### Purpose
This document defines the requirements for improving **quality** in the MICE Story Builder app.  
The goal is to establish a reliable test suite, improve overall code maintainability, and fix existing bugs while keeping functionality unchanged.

This will help me (and AI collaborators) confidently modify or extend the application by verifying that core features continue to work.

---

## 1. Objectives

1. **Add a test suite** to validate existing features across frontend and backend.
2. **Refactor for code quality** — improve structure, naming, and readability without changing behavior.
3. **Fix bugs** reproducibly, using test-first verification (write failing test → fix → verify).
4. **Automate quality checks** — ensure all tests run in local and CI environments.

---

## 2. Scope

| Area | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Backend** | FastAPI app with endpoints for managing story cards (CRUD). |
| **Frontend** | React + Tailwind (or Daisy-UI) interface for interacting with MICE sections. |
| **Persistence** | LocalStorage or SQLite (depending on current setup). |
| **Testing Targets** | Functional behavior (Create, Edit, Delete, Persist), Rendering, and Styling regressions. |

---

## 3. Deliverables

| Deliverable | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| ✅ **Test Suite** | Working unit/integration tests for both backend and frontend. |
| ✅ **Code Quality Tools** | ESLint + Prettier (frontend), Ruff/Black (backend) configured and enforced. |
| ✅ **CI Workflow** | GitHub Action or equivalent runs all tests and lint checks on every push/PR. |
| ✅ **Bug Fixes** | Known issues resolved and covered by regression tests. |
| ✅ **Refactor** | Clean folder structure and improved readability without breaking existing behavior. |

## 4. Test Plan

### **Backend (FastAPI + Pytest)**
- [ ] `GET /health` returns 200.
- [ ] CRUD tests for `/cards`:
  - Create → Retrieve → Update → Delete.
  - Validate schema (id, section, title, description).
  - Ensure data persists between requests (in-memory or DB).
- [ ] Negative tests: invalid payloads return proper error codes.

### **Frontend (React + Vitest / React Testing Library)**
- [ ] Render test: app loads with all four MICE sections.
- [ ] CRUD interactions:
  - Add card → visible immediately.
  - Edit card → updates in DOM and persists after reload.
  - Delete card → removed from DOM and storage.
- [ ] LocalStorage mock test to confirm persistence.
- [ ] Snapshot or DOM structure test for layout regressions.

### **Integration (Optional, Stretch)**
- [ ] E2E test with Playwright simulating real user flow:
  1. Add → Edit → Delete a card.
  2. Verify persistence after reload.
  3. Ensure no console errors.

---

## 5. Refactoring Guidelines

| Category | Best Practice |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Naming** | Use descriptive names (`card`, `section`, `storyElement` instead of `item`). |
| **Structure** | Group by feature (`components/`, `hooks/`, `api/`, `tests/`). |
| **Duplication** | Extract reusable UI parts (forms, modals) and helper functions. |
| **State Management** | Prefer `useContext` or simple store over deep prop passing. |
| **Consistency** | Apply consistent linting and formatting rules across the repo. |
| **Comments** | Use docstrings/JSDoc where behavior isn’t obvious. |

---

## 6. Verification Criteria

The work is **complete** when all of the following are true:

- [ ] All backend and frontend tests pass locally (`pytest`, `npm test`).
- [ ] Linting and formatting checks pass with zero errors.
- [ ] No console or runtime errors appear during manual testing.
- [ ] GitHub Action (or CI pipeline) runs and passes automatically on push/PR.
- [ ] Known bugs (from demo or local testing) are fixed and covered by tests.
- [ ] Documentation updated: `README` includes “How to run tests”.

---

## 7. Commands Reference

```bash
# Backend
pytest --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings -q
pytest --cov=app tests/

# Frontend
npm run lint
npm run test

# CI trigger
git push origin main
````

---

## 8. Stretch Goals (Optional Enhancements)

* [ ] Add Playwright E2E suite.
* [ ] Add visual regression tests (Chromatic or Percy).
* [ ] Integrate pre-commit hooks (lint + test) for local dev enforcement.
* [ ] Collect coverage reports in CI.
* [ ] Add `make quality` command to run all checks with one shortcut.

---

### Notes for AI Collaboration

When AI is used for refactoring or test generation:

* Provide this file as part of the system prompt.
* Give the AI access to the relevant code paths (`frontend/src/...`, `backend/app/...`).
* Ask the AI to **propose test cases first** before writing code.
* Use iterative verification: run → inspect → fix failing tests → rerun.

---

**Outcome:**
A high-confidence, maintainable, and test-verified foundation for future Story Builder development.
